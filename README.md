# School Manager
A School Manager Website to add students and classes to a simple database

## How It's made?
I used flask for the backend, and for the frontend templates, Jinja2 was the tool used to build them.
The database used was sqlite3, which is built-in with python3.

## What features does it include?
* Add new students to the database.
* List all users.
* Create a new class.
* List all existing classes in database.

## What did I learn?
From this project, I learned how to build a fullstack application using only Python and HTML, for the structure. Flask is a simple framework that permitted me apply some concepts studied.
SQLite3 is a simple database located in a single file, and let me practice some SQL instructions.
